            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU have not thought fit to acquaint the World by what Name or Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle you are dignified, or diſtinguiſhed, or where you dwell: and if I ſhould know where your Parſonage or Vicarage-Houſe ſtands, your Book gives me reaſon to think, that if I directed my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thither, it would not find you at home. And therefore I know not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63050:4"/>
how to Salute you, but from the Preſs.</p>
            <p>'Tis not my deſign to find fault with any thing in your Book which is honeſt, or tolerable. I ſhall paſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſome expreſſions, which will not bear a Cenſure, and not call you to account for every undecent, or impertinent paſſage: and if you had dealt thus with thoſe whom you call Antipluraliſts, I had had leſs to ſay to you.</p>
            <p>You complain in your Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome both of our Friends and Enemies, who have made too violent exclamations againſt Pluralities in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. But I deſire you ſeriouſly to conſider whether you have not been tranſported to the contrary extreme, and endeavoured to palliate and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie ſome things, which are really blameable, and ſinful: I know that upon all occaſions men of your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, when you are purſued by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, take your ſelves to the Church as a ſure Sanctuary, and no man muſt undertake to queſtion, or contradict what you ſay, upon peril of being lookt upon and treated as her
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63050:4"/>
Enemies. Though our Church pretends not to Infallibility, or Perfection; yet ſome who would be thought her choiceſt Sons, ſeem to affect ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very much like it. They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to put the Stamp of her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority upon their own private opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and even faults, and impeach all ſuch as will not admit them to be Current and Authentick, for Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Diſobedience. And I do not know that our excellent Church hath reaſon to be aſham'd of any thing more than ſuch Sons, who would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the World that their perſonal faults are committed by her Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and countenanced by her Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
            <p>Such men as theſe, thinking to make amends for failure in what is their proper Duty, uſually overdo the buſineſs in bluſtring and talking for her, and in a ſuperconformity as to leſſer, and external matters; and, which looks very ugly in Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, they uſually ſlight, and vilifie thoſe of their Brethren, who conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiouſly, and induſtriouſly diſcharge their duty, as a ſort of popular, and,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63050:5"/>
which amongſt them is ſcandal enough, moderate men, eſpecially if they up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any occaſion expreſs their diſlike of enormous Pluralities, and Non-Reſidence. Some of thoſe ſevere things which you ſay of ſome City-Preachers may be true. And yet I believe that moſt of them do more Service to the Church than any Non-reſident Pluraliſts, or even the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of them. They keep many in her boſome, and in tolerable confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to her, who would ſoon be frighted into a Conventicle by a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of your temper.</p>
            <p>But if they are to be blamed who Preach not ſo diſcretely as they ought, how much more ought you in juſtice to blame thoſe, who hardly Preach at all, at leaſt in ſuch places as they ſhould? And pray let me know by the next, what reaſon you have to be ſo very angry with thoſe honeſt Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who whilſt they themſelves faithfully perform their Office, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times reflect upon others for not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the like, as to call them <hi>Puritans, Infidels, Traditors:</hi> and to treat thoſe who are guilty of the greateſt fault
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63050:5"/>
that Miniſters well can be, <hi>viz.</hi> neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of the Souls of People commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their charge, ſo very gently? Let me know upon what grounds you deal with the former as Enemies to the Church, and not the latter. 'Tis natural for men who do their own duty, and bear the heat and burden of the day, to be moved at the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and lazineſs of them who ſhould be their Fellow-labourers, eſpecially if they find themſelves rewarded by their Superiours with nothing but Scorn, and Contempt; and the others puniſhed for their Idleneſs with the beſt Livings, and Preferments. 'Tis no wonder if ſome men concern'd have perhaps too deeply reſented, and warmly declared againſt ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. I am apt to think that if ſo deſerving a perſon, as your ſelf, Sir, ſhould have had the ill luck to have had your merits overlook'd, and gotten no Benefice at all, or a very mean one, and had ſeen many inferior to your ſelf in true worth, rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided for, you might thereby have been provok'd to write as zealouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt Pluralities, as you now write
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63050:6"/>
for them:<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> 185.</note> 
               <hi>If yet a Soul oppreſs'd with poverty could ever have rais'd it ſelf to attempt any ſuch great deſign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may wonder how I am got al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready almoſt to the end of your Book; but the reaſon of my referring to theſe words is, becauſe you ſeem plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that Paragraph to inform the World how you come to be an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, <hi>viz.</hi> by your being a Pluraliſt and Non-reſident. For there you would perſwade us that hardly any but ſuch can be Writers. But if you have no excuſe for your abſence from, or neglect of your Cures, but this, take my word for it, you had better be amongſt your <hi>Ruſricks,</hi> as you are pleaſed to call your Pariſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners.</p>
            <p>Tho' if a man have a mind to be an Author, I do not know why he may not be ſo, and yet ſerve his Cures too. I deſpair ever to ſee you ſo effectually to ſerve the Church by writing, as the Bleſſed <hi>Richard Hooker</hi> did, who perform'd the Office of a diligent Paſtor, during the time of his writing thoſe moſt Excellent Books of <hi>Eccl. Polity.</hi> You are pleaſed to ſay,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63050:6"/>
that <hi>to your certain knowledge he had,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>and dyed poſſeſſed of very great Preferments:</hi> and yet one may dare ſay he was no Pluraliſt, and Non-reſident; if he had, we ſhould have heard of that too.</p>
            <p>And here, Sir, I muſt tell you, that one grievous thing I have to charge you with, is that under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of proving Plurality, and Non-reſidence, to be lawful <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> you undertake to ſay, that a Miniſter hath no obligation to perſonal labour in his Charge, and that he may if he pleaſe be abſent altogether from them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sit ſtill, O Pluraliſt, Eat, Drink and be Merry. Farm out your Benefices, and make the beſt of them. And let the Curate look to the diſcharge of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and Duty to God and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. You have your</hi> Quietus <hi>given you by our Author. There will never any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count be required of you for the Souls of your People, nor your own neither.</hi> For if Miniſters, and eſpecially Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bents are not accountable for neglect of duty to the Souls intruſted with them, there is no reaſon to think that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63050:7"/>
any other men ſhould be puniſhed in another World for the Non-perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of any other obligation what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. And yet that you are guilty of doing this, appears from what you ſay in reference to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Biſhops in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> who would have had Reſidence of Biſhops to be declared neceſſary <hi>Jure Divino.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which <hi>if the Spaniſh Biſhops,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ag. 24, 25.</note> ſay you, <hi>had been asked, whether the Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which they aſſerted to be of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right, included the whole year, or only part of it, they could not have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in it. If Reſidence of the whole Year were required by the Law of God, by what Authority did they appear in that place out of their Dioceſes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If only partial Reſidence were required, who ſhould define how much God would accept, or how much might lawfully be ſpent out of their Dioceſes? It might have been alleged againſt them, that ſince God himſelf had revealed nothing as to this matter, it was an evident Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he intended no ſuch obligation:</hi> So that according to your wiſe way of arguing, to reſide even any the leaſt part of a year in ones Biſhoprick is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63050:7"/>
not neceſſary <hi>Jure Divino.</hi> And you do yet more openly aſſert this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, when you bring the Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent before the great Tribunal at the laſt day, and like a truſty Advocate for the Non-reſident Pluraliſt, you plead thus for him.<note place="margin">Pag. 33, 34.</note> 
               <hi>And then as to a Proxy, if the Priest allegeth that the ſame Authority of the Biſhop, which committed the Care of the Pariſh to him, did disburden him of that Care, and impoſed it in whole, or in part upon a Subſtitute, there is no reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God will not accept this plea.</hi> Here you ſpeak out indeed, and all at once. For if a Cure may be <hi>wholly</hi> ſerved by a Subſtitute, and if God at the day of Judgment will accept of ſuch a Plea, then 'tis plain that all perſonal care and labour is unneceſſary. But, Sir, 'tis to be hoped <hi>before that great and terrible day of the Lord's, comes,</hi> you will learn more Seriouſneſs and Modeſty, than to think of preferring ſo thin and falſe an excuſe to ſo great a Judge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:63050:8"/>A falſe Excuſe I ſay. For what Statute, or Canon of the Realm, or Church of <hi>England</hi> doth authorize a Biſhop to disburden an Incumbent of the Care of his Pariſh, and impoſe it <hi>in whole</hi> upon a Subſtitute? I know that Diſpenſations may be had for Local Non-reſidence. But I challenge you, or any Man elſe to produce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Authority that the Biſhop hath, either by our Canon, or Statute-Law to transferr the Cure of Souls <hi>wholly</hi> from the Incumbent to another. Though when I conſider you as an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquary, I have a good mind to revoke my challenge. For you may have Rods in Brine, and Canons perdue, which a Countrey Gentleman never heard of before. And we need not deſpair of having any thing made out by Men vers'd in ſuch Studies, ſince we have had ſuch Doctrines publiſhed as the genuine Product of the Church of <hi>England</hi> repreſented in Convocation, which the hundredth part of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy themſelves knew nothing of, till they had layn in the dark about 80 years, and were at laſt publiſhed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63050:8"/>
to prove ſome new Doctrine, or elſe for nothing at all.</p>
            <p>But let me as a Friend once more remind you of that wretched Plea which it ſeems you intend to make for your ſelf and Brethren, at the laſt day; conſider of it again, and tell me whether you think it can paſs in that great Court: nay whether your own Conſcience, if you would let it ſpeak out, can vouch it, or rely upon it. I am ſo far from thinking that it will be accepted <hi>by him who is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than our Conſciences, and knoweth all things,</hi> That a Civil or Eccleſiaſtick Judge would, or at leaſt ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it. For 'tis certain if any Biſhop ſhould pretend to a power beyond Law, and Canon, and the Nature of things, all ſuch pretenſions would be vain both as to this World and another. And I believe 'tis as certain and true that no Biſhop of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> as now eſtabliſhed did ever aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume ſuch a ſort of Authority. If any Prelate had a faculty of looſing Men from the obligations to their People, I doubt not but he might have as much Cuſtom amongſt ſome of your Friends,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63050:9"/>
as 'tis uſually ſaid that Prieſt might have who could procure a Commiſſion for unmarrying People. And for ought I could ever yet learn, any Prieſt may as well and legally do the latter, as a Biſhop the former.</p>
            <p>The Notion of transferring the Charge from the Incumbent to the Curate is new, and, I hope, your own. I do believe that 'twas never heard of in General Council, Parliament, or Convocation. And if you have no better thoughts to communicate to that Reverend Body laſt mentioned, I hope you will never have the Vote of an honeſt Clergyman to ſit in it. But when you write again, pray let us know by what Inſtruments, Letters, or Faculties a Biſhop doth, or can releaſe an Incumbent <hi>wholly</hi> from his charge, or in what Court ſuch Letters Diſpenſatory can be procured. For I believe I know ſome who would give money for them: tho' I do not imagine any good Man would. For I do not think that any Humane Power can take off that obligation which every Miniſter hath upon him of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Labour amongſt his People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:63050:9"/>I ſhall reduce what I have to ſay on this ſubject, to theſe following Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Tho' Plurality of Benefices be not in it ſelf contrary to the Law of God; yet for any one to take on himſelf ſuch Charges as he cannot, or will not perform, is.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Tho' Curates may be uſed for the more full, and perfect diſcharge of Duty; yet the whole Care of the people is not intruſted with them.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Tho' perpetual Local Reſidence be not injoined by God; yet to live ſo near the Cure, and to be actually reſident, ſo far forth as effectually to anſwer all the ends of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, is.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Vicars by reaſon of their Oaths are obliged to Local Reſidence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they be diſpenſed with by the Biſhop</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:63050:10"/>I. Tho' Plurality of Benefices be not in it ſelf contrary to the Law of God; yet for any one to take on himſelf ſuch Charges, as he cannot, or will not perform, is. It cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed with any appearance of Truth be aſſerted, that 'tis unlawful to ſerve or have more Benefices than one. The Scriptures do neither in expreſs Terms, nor by any Conſequence fairly to be drawn from them, prohibit it. And thus far we are agreed (I ſay) as to the Concluſion, tho' not as to the Premiſes. For one of the arguments by which you would prove this, is a meer Cavill: I mean that pag. 37 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where you undertake to conclude the Lawfulneſs of Pluralities <hi>from the Authority, and Example of the primitive Church;</hi> and that 'tis lawful to hold two Biſhopricks, becauſe ſome Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Biſhops preſided over two ſeveral Cities. Now did ever any one in his right Wits aſſert the Bounds, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of Dioceſes and Pariſhes to be fixed by a <hi>Jus Divinum?</hi> Do not you frequently throughout your Book ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63050:10"/>
them to be conſtituted, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by Laws Humane, and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical? And if it be left to men to bound out the precincts, why may they not alter, unite and divide them as they pleaſe? The Primitive Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples you your ſelf anſwer, and prove them to be of no force by the Canon which you quote; part of which ſays, <hi>Civitates praedictae nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam proprios Epiſcopos habuerunt.</hi> For if thoſe Cities were never two diſtinct Dioceſes, then he who held them could not be a Dualiſt even accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your own argument, unleſs you take it for granted, That a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian City, <hi>qua talis,</hi> be a Biſhop's See, which I am ſure you will never be able to prove. Some of our preſent Dioceſes do indeed contain ſuch an extent of Land, as formerly made two: but how came they of old to be two, was it not meerly from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Authority? and why may not things be altered by the ſame Power they were at firſt conſtituted? And therefore I am aſham'd to hear you trifle and cry out <hi>Pag.</hi> 39. <hi>No humane
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63050:11"/>
Authority can make that lawful, which God and the Nature of things have made unlawful.</hi> Whoever ſaid that God and the nature of things divided Dioceſes, and Pariſhes? And what Child's play is it to talk as you do, <hi>Pag.</hi> 42. where you would prove the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Pluralities from the lawfulneſs of one that is Biſhop of one Dioceſe, to undertake the Adminiſtration of another, during its vacancy, or the incapacity of him to whom it belongs? I will only obſerve that you make the Biſhop of <hi>Sarum</hi> to lead the Van in both Caſes, and look upon it not as an argument, but a Jeſt <hi>ad hominem.</hi> It ill becomes one who pretends ſo great a Reverence and Tenderneſs for the Order, as you do, always to be aiming at a Biſhop, and ſtudying to expoſe him; tho hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, God be thanked, you have expoſed your ſelf moſt of all. But if you do not take more care of your ſelf, you will become one of the Traditors before you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:63050:11"/>And yet, as I ſaid, though I agree not with you in this <hi>medium,</hi> yet thus far I agree with you in the Concluſion, That Plurality is not in it ſelf againſt the Divine Law: and conſidering the Poverty of ſome Churches, 'tis abſolutely neceſſary: and ſome men may better merit, and ſerve two, than others one; and therefore in God's Name let them have 'em. Yet,</p>
            <p>No Man ought to have more Souls committed to his Charge than he can or will watch over. This doth evidently appear, both from the Law of Nature, and the Goſpel, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you pretend to the contrary. For I think it will be needleſs to prove that by them both we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to perform our promiſes, and execute the ſeveral Offices we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take: and unleſs you have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten your Vows, and Engagements plighted to God, and his People, at your Ordination, you cannot but know that 'tis the Vow and Office of a Presbyter of the Church of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63050:12"/>
               <hi>England,</hi> to watch over and inſtruct the People committed to his charge. And he who ſhall ſay, that he is not obliged to ſerve in the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his charge, doth in effect renounce his Orders in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And he who ſhall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſert, That he is not obliged by the Vows and Promiſes which he hath made (if they are not unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) doth in conſequence renounce the Chriſtian, and even Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And he who undertakes any Engagements which he knows he cannot perform, or makes any Vows he reſolves not to fulfill, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them, he doth worſe than break them. So that he who accepts ſo many, or great Benefices, as he cannot or will not look after, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes the Law of Chriſt and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture too. But there are two things pretended in this Caſe. 1. The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the Biſhop. To which I anſwer, That there is no Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be had for perpetual Non-reſidence, and neglect of the People. Tho' I muſt confeſs the Diſpenſations
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63050:12"/>
are larger than a good man would wiſh for; yet they will not come up to your purpoſe. You often indeed call upon the Biſhops to execute the Diſcipline of the Church, and to make Incumbents perform the Terms and Conditions of their Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is, to Preach Thirteen times a Year in each Church, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide two Months, which is too little in all conſcience: and yet as little as it is, I do not doubt but if the good Biſhops ſhould take you at your word, and ſend you and your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to labour amongſt your <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks,</hi> you would think your ſelves ſeverely handled, and look on it as a harder impoſition, than that which the Parliament lays upon you, and be ready to cry out of an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Perſecution.</p>
            <p>I ſhould look on that Pluraliſt to have ſomething of Conſcience, who having gotten two of the beſt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings in Thirty Miles diſtance, ſhould do at leaſt what the Canon, and his Diſpenſation requires of him. 'Tis
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63050:13"/>
but a low pitch of vertue to be juſt ſo good as the Law of Man would have us; and yet it were well, if ſuch as you defend (eſpecially your dear ſelf) could do but this. Your Diſpenſations, which you now plead in your own defence, ſhall hereafter riſe up in Judgment againſt you. For I know many Pluraliſts, (and I believe, Sir, you know one at leaſt) who Preach not half ſo often, and reſide not half ſo much upon both their Livings, as they ought to do in each. And yet after all, if the Diſpenſation were as full as you could deſire, it would certainly be invalid, as tending to the Breach of Vows, which no Chriſtian Biſhop can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to without uſurping a Papal Power. He who ſhall undertake to annull a Miniſter's Vows of feeding the People committed to his charge, may by the ſame Authority diſpenſe with my Oath of Allegiance, or with thoſe Natural duties which I owe to my Parents or Children.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:63050:13"/>But ſome have anſwered, That theſe Vows and Promiſes are to be taken in a legal ſence, and are qualified by thoſe words, <hi>according to the Order of this Church of England:</hi> ſo that he who takes no more Liberty than the Canons of this Church allow, cannot juſtly be accuſed for violation of his Faith.</p>
            <p>But 1ſt. The Church allows no ſuch liberty as that of perpetual Non-reſidence, and neglect of labour, as is already proved.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, Theſe words do not at all affect our obligation to perſonal la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and therefore cannot in the leaſt mitigate or abate it. And that this may appear, I will ſet down the whole Queſtion, of which theſe words are part. <hi>Do you think in your heart that you be truly called, according to the will of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Order of this Church of</hi> England, <hi>to the Order, and Miniſtry of Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood?</hi> And I need only ſet them down, to ſhew that they do not at
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63050:14"/>
all concern the preſent Controverſie. And 'tis the only inſtance of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, which you have given us in your whole Book, that you have not ſo much as mentioned this Argument, as ſome miſcall it. But</p>
            <p>Further, another plea whereby you endeavour to waſh off the Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans obligation to labour among his People, and which ſeems to be the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the fundamental Error of your whole Book, is, <hi>that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are not ordained to one Dioceſe, or Pariſh, but to the Catholick Church,</hi> Pag. 43. <hi>&amp; paſſim.</hi> Tho' you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſo much of the truth, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>good order and diſcipline do require that the exerciſe of their Office be confined to ſome certain limits, and place,</hi> as will determine every good man againſt the Concluſion you would draw from it. For if he who ſits not down on his Cures, and will not confine the exerciſe of his Office to the Church, or Churches intruſted with him, do break diſcipline, and good order; 'tis plain that he is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63050:14"/>
of a great crime. But I ſhall further ſhew that this Notion of a Miniſter's being ordained not to this or that Pariſh or Dioceſe, but to the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church, is falſe. Not but that upon occaſion he may exerciſe his Function in any part of the Church, and upon whatever ſhore he is caſt, he ought not to be re-ordained: but that when he enters into Orders, he is deſign'd for the ſervice of ſome particular Church, or Dioceſe, more than of the whole.</p>
            <p>As for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſhe ordains none (except in one or two ſpecial Caſes, which cannot break a rule) <hi>fine certo Titulo.</hi> And in the Office for ordering of Prieſts,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Can.</hi> 33.</note> among other queſtions asked by the Biſhop, this is one, <hi>Will you maintain and ſet forward Quietneſs, Peace and Love amongſt all Chriſtian people, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially among them that are, or ſhall be committed to your charge?</hi> And your ſelf I preſume have made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it in the words of the Office, <hi>I will do ſo, the Lord being my Helper.</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:63050:15"/>
Now in this queſtion, other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an People are contradiſtinguiſhed to thoſe of your Cure, and in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer you oblige your ſelf to proſecute your duty more eſpecially amongſt the latter.</p>
            <p>But you that would be called the true Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> write and act as if you were ſo much her fondlings, as that you had a particular priviledge of contradicting her. You can be very ſevere upon your Brethren of the Clergy <hi>who mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilate or diſuſe her Ceremonies:</hi> but think it no fault in your ſelves almoſt, or altogether to lay aſide the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of your Functions, at leaſt in ſuch places as the Canons and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the Church do peculiarly require your labours. I know no labouring Clergy of our Church who do mutilate or diſuſe her Ceremonies: but if I did, I ſhould think them more excuſable who do ſomething of their duty, than they who wholly neglect it. And, Sir, 'Tis ſuch as theſe that betray her Cauſe, that open the mouths
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63050:15"/>
of her Adverſaries, and give juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſcandal: And let me tell you, That you are partaker of theſe mens ſins, by pretending to juſtify them.</p>
            <p>And, take my word for it, the Church is very little beholden to you for your doing ſo: eſpecially ſince you have made bold with her, for a little arguments ſake, ſo far as to contradict her Offices and Canons. But alas! Canons and Rubricks, and ſuch like things were not made for Authors, and Grand Pluraliſts. They are ſo far from being obliged to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey them, that one would think they never read, or at leaſt remembred them. Otherwiſe how could any one who did not think himſelf above Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, confidently aſſert, That Prieſts are not ordained to this or that Pariſh; but to ſerve the Church of God in general, when the Church has ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decreed, That they are, or ought to be ordained to ſome particular Cure, and obliges them there more eſpecially to proſecute their Office.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:63050:16"/>And even in the Primitive and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Churches Men were not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained ſo much for the ſervice of the whole, as of one particular Dioceſe. The Apoſtles themſelves were indeed Catholick Biſhops in the largeſt ſence, and had a Commiſſion to <hi>teach all Nations,</hi> and had every one of them <hi>the care of all the Churches.</hi> But tho' they did not themſelves ſit down, and take up their Reſidence in any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Dioceſe: yet they conſtituted diſtinct and ſetled Governours for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Church as ſoon as it was raiſed. Thus St. <hi>Timothy</hi> was created Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus, Titus</hi> of <hi>Crete; Linus,</hi> or <hi>Cletus,</hi> or both, of <hi>Rome</hi> even during the Apoſtles lives.</p>
            <p>And as Biſhops were then deſign'd for every particular Dioceſe; ſo as the Number of the Chriſtians grew, 'twas abſolutely neceſſary that they ſhould have Presbyters ſubſervient to them. And 'tis evident that thoſe Presbyters did not only live in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Biſhops of thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Dioceſes to which they were
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63050:16"/>
ordained, ſo long as themſelves thought fit; but were obliged not to leave them without the conſent of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſan. And when the Levity of ſome prompted them to break this ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cuſtome of the Church, there were Canons made to confine all Biſhops and Presbyters to the Service of that Dioceſe to which they were firſt ordained. And there is only this difference between the Primitive Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and our own, <hi>viz.</hi> That in the former Presbyters were ordained not for the Service of one particular Congregation, but of the whole Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe, to ſerve the Biſhop in the more full and perfect diſcharge of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to be ſent to ſuch parts of the Dioceſe, and for ſuch a time as the Biſhop thought fit: whereas by our Conſtitution every Presbyter has his particular Allotment, and his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Dividend in the endowments, and labours of the Church. But they were no more deſigned for the Service of the Church at large in thoſe days, than they are now.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:63050:17"/>If we enquire why every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Presbyter had not his diſtinct Cure allotted him in the primitive Church, we muſt needs allow it to be its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant and unſetled State: So that when the Empire came into the Church, and Chriſtianity began to be the Religion of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> all Churches ſoon fell into a Parochial Diviſion. And that ſo early, that at the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> it ſeems to have been a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Eſtabliſhment, for there it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that <hi>No one ſhall be ordained a Prieſt or Deacon at large</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>to be at his own Liberty, but ſhould be aſſigned particularly</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>to ſome Church either in the City or in a Village,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Can.</hi> 6.</note> 
               <hi>or Martyrdome, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery.</hi> I know you are not willing to allow Pariſh-Prieſts or Churches to have been generally conſtituted at this time; but I think this is a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Authority for it, than you can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce againſt it. It could not indeed be ſo early in our Church, which was then under a Cloud, Barbariſm and Infidelity generally prevailing in theſe Iſlands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:63050:17"/>Now briefly to recapitulate what hath been ſaid on this Head. Since the Miniſtry is an Office, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore duly to be executed; ſince the Church in all Ages hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined the Exerciſe of this Office chiefly to the Dioceſe, or Pariſh to which Miniſters are ordained, or inſtituted; ſince the Church of <hi>England</hi> in particular exacts of them whom ſhe ordains, ſolemn Vows, and promiſes <hi>to inſtruct, and teach the People committed to their charge, to give wholſom Exhortations both to the ſick and whole within their Cures, to adminiſter Chriſtian Doctrines, and Sacraments to them, to drive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all erroneous and ſtrange Doctrine, to maintain peace and love as much as in them lyeth amongſt their Pariſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners.</hi> Since this cannot be done without perſonal care, and labour, and ſince the Church requires it at their hands, and neither doth nor can diſpence with their Neglect; it neceſſarily follows, that they who undertake ſuch Cures as they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63050:18"/>
are not able to diſcharge, or ſo many Churches as they cannot du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly watch over, do in undertaking them, groſly ſin: And that they who have promiſed and are able to perform, but will not, do violate their Faith made ſolemnly to God and his People.</p>
            <p>And what I have now ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes againſt you in two points.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> According to your Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis there are no bounds ſet to Pluralities by the Law of God (tho' the Church be ſo ſevere as to ſtint you to two) but that a Man may have as many as he can get, and have ſerved by Curates. Your Reaſon againſt Pluralities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unlawful is, <hi>That there is no mention made of Pariſh-Prieſts, or Churches, in Holy Scripture, and therefore there can be no directions concerning them,</hi> pag. 17. Now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this way of arguing it follows, That he who ſhall procure a 100 Benefices or ten times more, doth not tranſgreſs the Divine Law.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63050:18"/>
And therefore <hi>Bogo de Clare</hi> and <hi>Adam de Straton</hi> pag. 143. are clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought off from treſpaſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the divine Law, though the latter had 23 Benefices in one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and the other you know not how many in both. For you tell us plainly pag. 141, 142. <hi>That whereas Arch-Biſhop</hi> Pecham <hi>inveigh'd againſt Plurality of Benefices as a mortal ſin, he proceeded upon a falſe Principle.</hi> ('Tis pity you did not live in thoſe days, for I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that you might have ſaved this honeſt <hi>Adam</hi> the 30000 Marks and upwards which <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt fined him for Corruption in the Exchequer, (if it were the ſame man, as probably it was) I am ſure you might as eaſily have proved that taking of Bribes was no Mortal Sin, as that ſuch enormous Pluralities were not ſo.) And pag. 195. having fairly reckoned up all the faults of Extravagant and Irregular Pluraliſts, yet you cannot find in your heart to call them directly ſinful, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matter <hi>of great Inconvenience to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63050:19"/>
the Church, and Scandal to Religion.</hi> And every one knows that a thing may be Inconvenient, and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, and yet have no intrinſic evil in it. Eſpecially if the Scandal be only taken, and not given. O how ſweetly do you treat your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the Non-Reſident Pluraliſts. One of theſe may break all the Ten Commandments with leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof from you, than a poor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious Clergy-man omit a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. He that doth the latter is in your language <hi>a Traditor, an Infidel, or</hi> (which with you perhaps is worſe) <hi>a Puritan;</hi> but the other, tho' <hi>he behave himſelf as though he cared not for the Souls of his People, tho' he think himſelf wholly disburthened of the Cure of Souls</hi> (as you had already taught them to do) <hi>by delegating it to a Curate, tho' he put no bounds to the deſire of Pluralities, tho he neglect Alms, and Hoſpitality, and ſuffer his houſes to be dilapidated,</hi> pag. 193. And tho' he do half a hundred more ſuch ugly tricks, all this is only inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and offenſive.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:63050:19"/>Now upon this Suppoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That Pluralities, though never ſo numerous, are not contrary to the Divine Law, there needs but one metropolitan Biſhop in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, (a Pope you may call him if you pleaſe) ſo that he maintain a great Army of Stipen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diary Suffragans, and (which is a Doctrine which I think the World never heard of before) but one incumbent Presbyter under him maintaining Legions of Curates in every Kingdom. For if it be not a mortal ſin to have 23 Benefices, how do you prove it ſo to have as many hundred, or thouſand. 'T would indeed be <hi>Scandalous, i. e.</hi> weak Brethren might take offence at it. But you will ſay 'tis pity ſuch a Conſtitution ſhould be ſinful. Oh! what a rare Author would ſuch a brave fellow as this Univerſal Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter make? he might write a whole Vatican full of Books, and gratify you perhaps ſo far as to enable you to continue writing lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63050:20"/>
Defences, and to make ſuch wonderful diſcoveries as you have lately, in acquainting the World how many Children Biſhop <hi>O.</hi> had, for ſtarting the project.</p>
            <p>But I am afraid you will be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with me for ſpoiling this new invention, as I think I have ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually done. For if every one who is inſtituted in a Living be oblig'd perſonally to take care of it; then he, who undertakes more or greater Cures than he is capable of looking after, ſins in doing of it.</p>
            <p>But another ill conſequence of your Hypotheſis is, That Livings may be held at never ſo great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. So that for ought appears in your Book to the contrary, nay by what is there aſſerted, it is lawful <hi>jure Divino</hi> for a Man to hold 3 or more Benefices, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one we will ſuppoſe ſituate in <hi>Britaine,</hi> the ſecond in <hi>Japan,</hi> and the third in <hi>Peru,</hi> (and I fancy you
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63050:20"/>
would chuſe a Golden one) why may they not be 30 Degrees di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant as well as 30 Miles accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your way of arguing, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the Livings cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally be ſupplied in any ſence</hi> pag. 28. But if it be true which I have laid down, <hi>viz.</hi> That 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to take two Benefices or more, which you cannot perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and very frequently ſupply; if it be neceſſary that he who hath ſolemnly accepted the charge of any people, be by his Office, and other additional obligations tyed to watch over their Souls, to deliver to them the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of God, and to be ready on all occaſions to preſerve them from Error, and Diſcord, and the like Spiritual Evils; then it clearly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that 'tis contrary to the Law of God to take the charge of two or more livings ſo far diſtant from each other, that it ſhall be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally impoſſible for him in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure perſonally to ſupply them both. The Church indeed allows of 30 Miles
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63050:21"/>
diſtance, tho' the Canons of 1571. permit but 26. But I do not think it an argument of an affectionate and ingenuous Son to ſtretch the favours of his indulgent Mother, or to run to the utmoſt bounds which ſhe hath ſet him. 'Tis as difficult for a Man to determine the preciſe diſtance, which is lawful, as to preſcribe the number of Glaſſes which any Man may drink, without exceeding the rules of Temperance. And yet I dare ſay you will agree with me that 30 together are too many for one who deſigns to keep himſelf ſober: And ſo without doubt is 30 Miles diſtance of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es too great for that Man who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends conſcientiouſly to diſcharge his Office. And this is certainly true generally ſpeaking. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the great ſtrength of ſome mens Brains or Bodies; I will not determine that this number is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely exceſſive, and unlawful in either Caſes. Tho' I think I may with decency enough ſay that the Church allows this great diſtance,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63050:21"/>
only <hi>for the hardneſs of ſome mens hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis the ſafeſt way in ſuch caſes to take care that you do not make uſe of that <hi>Liberty</hi> which the Church hath given you <hi>for an occaſion to the fleſh,</hi> to Covetouſneſs, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Lucre. But I proceed to ſhew that,</p>
            <p n="2">II. Tho' Curates may be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, yet the whole care of the people is not intruſted with them. I am ſo far from thinking it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to keep a Curate, that I rather judge it commendable, where the Living will bear one, and the people are any thing numerous. For though a man have no greater a charge than that he himſelf may ſerve the neceſſities of; yet he may not ſo well anſwer all the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and reaſonable deſires of the people in his own perſon. There are many Incumbents, who may <hi>fulfill their Miniſtry</hi> by their own labour, at leaſt ſo far as to keep
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63050:22"/>
themſelves <hi>free from the bloud</hi> of the People, and yet might diſcharge their truſt much more to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification, and ſatisfaction of the people, and their own Conſciences by the aſſiſtance of another. And there is no reaſon to think that it is more unlawful for a Clergyman than for any other Officer, or Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to have an Aſſiſtant. And it would be of excellent uſe to the Church, if ſuch as are deſigned for Incumbents were all for ſome time trained up under the care of grave and experienced Clergy-men, that by practiſing under them, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by their directions, and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by their example, they might be better verſed in ſo great a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, than young Incumbents uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally are.</p>
            <p>But yet I am far from thinking that the whole care of the people is or ought to be intruſted with Curates. 'Tis plain it is not in our Church: becauſe no Incumbent is or can be acquitted from that obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63050:22"/>
which he voluntarily took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf of caring for, and feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Souls of his people; and therefore is obliged to do it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he have a Curate to help him. I have before ſhewed that your Notion of transferring the obligation from the Incumbent to the Curate is groundleſs. And in all the forms of Licences to ſerve a Cure which I have ſeen, there is not any thing contained, that implies the Curate to have the ſole Care of the people. 'Tis true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in ſuch Churches as have no Eccleſiaſtical perſon incumbent on them by reaſon of all the Tithes being impropriated, either the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate muſt do all, or elſe it cannot be done. But I know you look on this as an odious caſe, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the condition of ſuch Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es as much as any Clergyman in <hi>England.</hi> From anomalies nothing can be proved, or brought into a Rule. I doubt not but there are many learned, and pious Curates in the Church, who do as much for
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63050:23"/>
the People as if they were their Rectors, or Vicars; and 'tis pity they are not. I do not ſpeak this to diſcourage their honeſt labours, but only to ſhew the neglect of thoſe who employ them. And the generality of Curates cannot but know that the great, and primary charge belongs to the Incumbent: and cannot think it reaſonable that for a third, or perhaps a ſixth, or tenth part of the Profits, he is obliged to do ſo much as the Rector, or Vicar, for the whole: on the contrary the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent, if we may judge of all by you, thinks that if he pay for ſerving the Cure, he himſelf is disburdened of all obligations. And ſo the Pariſh has the name of two Miniſters, but in effect not one.</p>
            <p>In caſe of Age or Sickneſs, or any other neceſſary diſability to perform all the duty required of an Incumbent, 'tis to be ſure ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to do <hi>what in him lyeth,</hi> as
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63050:23"/>
the Office of Ordination expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it. He muſt then be forced to make uſe of anothers Mouth and Hands to Preach, and pray and deliver Sacraments to the People. And yet it will be ſome ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a Conſciencious Paſtor, if he be able to direct his Curate, and to ſee that he do that which now he himſelf cannot, and to take care that his people want nothing that is neceſſary, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for their Souls health. And 'twere well if ſome Incumbents would do but thus much even during their health, and ſtrength, tho I don't think that this is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to acquit ſuch before God.</p>
            <p>And this brings me to the caſe of Deacon-Incumbents. For you ſay <hi>p.</hi> 136. that <hi>to manifeſt more fully that 'twas never the deſign in the firſt Inſtitution of Parochial Cures that they ſhould in all caſes be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the Incumbent in perſon, I will add this obſervation, That from the beginning of Parochial Cures
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63050:24"/>
Deacons were admitted to poſſeſs them, altho it were notorious that they could not execute the Office per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally: Since they could neither ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve penitents, nor celebrate the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Euchariſt.</hi> I do not think you have proved what you ſay, namely that <hi>from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Parochial Cures, Deacons were admitted to poſſeſs them.</hi> The firſt Authority which you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce for it in the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, is in the year 744. Whereas <hi>this Parochial diviſion was long before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced in</hi> France, <hi>namely, at fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt in the year</hi> 630, if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what you ſay <hi>Pag.</hi> 84. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions may be introduced in 114 years. And if I were diſpoſed to be troubleſome, I might very well deny either the Canon, or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitular which you quote, <hi>Pag.</hi> 137, to prove that Deacons were then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of for Incumbents: but let it be ſo, you ſhall for this one time have your will. Deacons have formerly been allowed to be Incumbents, and perhaps from the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63050:24"/>
firſt beginning of Parochial Churches; therefore it follows, ſay you, that the Church never deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Cures in all Caſes ſhould be ſupplied by the Incumbents. But doth it from thence follow, that he is not obliged to do any thing? Becauſe he could not abſolve, and celebrate the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, doth it from thence follow, that he had no obligation to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize the Children, viſit, and anoint the Sick, carry the conſecrated Elements to them? give them oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional advice, Catechiſe them in the Principles of Religion, and do thoſe things which daily were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in every Pariſh, and what, if he made uſe of an Aſſiſtant to do the reſt, ſo long as he did not think himſelf disburdened of doing what he could? A Miniſter diſabled in his Hands by the Gout or Palſy, may without queſtion make uſe of another to adminiſter the Sacraments to his People, and yet by his diligence in other duties deſerve a double proportion of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:63050:25"/>
Honour, and Maintenance. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this caſe of Deacon-Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bents doth not at all ſerve the purpoſe of the Clergy of the now <hi>Church of England.</hi> For 'tis plain that the allowance of them was lookt upon as a Corruption by the Church and State; and therefore it hath been reformed by the Act of Uniformity. And if the former permiſſion of it were an argument that the Church did not then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Incumbents perſonally to ſupply their Cures; then the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent prohibition doth as ſtrongly prove that now ſhe doth. And to what end are all Incumbents obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be in Prieſts Orders, but only that they may be capable of performing all Holy Offices in their Cures, unleſs by natural infirmities diſabled? I have particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the force of this allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: becauſe it looks the moſt like an argument of any thing in your Book. But,</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:63050:25"/>III. Though perpetual local Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence be not required by the Law of God, yet to live ſo near the Cure, and to be actually reſident ſo far forth as to anſwer all the ends of the Miniſtry, is I am ſo far of your mind, as that God and Nature have made no particular Laws to appoint on what ſpot of ground the Miniſter's houſe ſhall ſtand: but yet, 'tis abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that he ſhould watch over the flock; and therefore it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follows, that he muſt be ſo much amongſt them, and dwell ſo near them, as that he may effectually perform this duty. 'Tis a thing high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proper perpetually to reſide, where it can be done with any tolerable ſafety, or accommodation. He that doth ſo may have more frequent opportunities of doing good, and may more eaſily, and throughly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his Conſcience: and ſome Cures cannot be faithfully ſerved but by reſident Miniſters, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the multitude of Pariſhioners, and their daily occaſions. And in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63050:26"/>
ſuch caſes 'tis without doubt as neceſſary that the Miniſter ſhould reſide, as it is that he ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his duty, and vows. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſo near all ought to dwell, and ſo often to be with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners, as that no Soul may be in danger of periſhing, no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary duty neglected through their abſence. And indeed gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſpeaking, dwelling in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh where a man is beneficed is ſo very requiſite, that it were very much to be deſired that thoſe Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bents who have not an important excuſe to the contrary, were forced to legal, and local reſidence.</p>
            <p>When I ſpeak of reſidence and dwelling in the Pariſh, I mean it in the ſame ſenſe that any plain Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman will take it, <hi>viz</hi> making it the place of abode, and rambling abroad as little as may be, or as is conſiſtent with the greater buſineſs, which every Miniſter hath lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his hands. I ſay this, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind you of your little banters,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:63050:26"/>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 26. &amp;c. <hi>Suppoſe,</hi> ſay you, <hi>the Incumbent lives not here,</hi> (viz. <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bounds of his Pariſh) but</hi> 100 <hi>yards further,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and</hi> Pag. 27. <hi>If ten diſtance miles be allowed, why not</hi> 20 <hi>or</hi> 30? You might have added 100, or 1000. For your argument is indefinite, and pleads for 10000 miles diſtance as well as ten. The caſe of the Spaniſh Biſhops is ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that I muſt mention it again. <hi>Pag.</hi> 24. You ask them <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Reſidence, which they aſſerted to be of Divine Right, included the whole year, or only part of it. If Reſidence of the whole year were required by the Law of God, by what warrant did they appear in that place</hi> (viz. <hi>Trent) out of their Dioceſes, or,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly partial reſidence were required, who ſhould define how much God would accept it, might have been alledged— that ſince God himſelf had revealed nothing as to this matter, it is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Argument he intended no ſuch obligation.</hi> Has God revealed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as to this matter? Yes he has revealed this, that <hi>you muſt give an
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:63050:27"/>
account of the people.</hi> Heb. 13.17. And no man can give an account of all, and therefore by <hi>People</hi> muſt be meant thoſe who are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly committed to your Charge: he hath told you by the Apoſtle, that you muſt take heed to the Flock, and be inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon; and this you cannot do, if you live too far diſtant from them. God hath been pleaſed in this, and many other particulars, only to give you the general heads of your duty. He commands us to be ſober, to avoid Covetouſneſs, and worldly Cares; to pray often, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without preſcribing the nice quantity of liquor, or meat, that we may uſe; without ſtinting men to a certain number of hours, or tale of Prayers: and yet there certainly are quantities and hours, which if we do not obſerve, we tranſgreſs theſe duties. So 'tis in the caſe before us, God hath on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded Miniſters in general terms to be very inſtant, and urgent to overſee, and take care of the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63050:27"/>
People, without telling us how far, or how long they may be abſent from them. And yet with all your little Sophiſtry you will never be able to wipe off the force of theſe Laws.</p>
            <p>But you have paſſed, or repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Jeſt in the beginning of your Book,<note place="margin">Pag. 20.</note> which puts me in mind of a parallel Inſtance. A man is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to take care of his own, and to dwell with his Wife, and that by the Law of God: but yet, if you were a married man, and had caught a ſhe <hi>Tartar,</hi> whom you would be willing to ſhake off; you might according to your way of arguing, make this Dilemma: If a man be obliged to dwell with his Wife, and reſide with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, he is either obliged to dwell in the ſame Houſe or Room with them, and that perpetually, and without any intermiſſion; or elſe at a ſmall diſtance, and only part of his time: if the former be true, then he muſt never be from
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:63050:28"/>
home, tho upon the moſt neceſſary occaſions, or even to make provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for his Family: but if he may live the next wall to them, and be ſometimes out for a day or a week, then why not altogether? For to uſe your own words, <hi>ſince God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has revealed nothing as to this matter, (i. e.</hi> the preciſe time or ſpace of being without Wives) <hi>'tis an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent argument, he intended no ſuch obligation,</hi> and ſo you might get rid of your Wife without the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of a Proceſs, or appealing to the Eccleſiaſtical Conſiſtory. Is not this pretty Tattle, and is not yours juſt the ſame? For your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt the neceſſity of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial reſidence runs thus. If a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter may be abſent ſometimes, as ſuppoſe to go to Convocation, or to buy Books at <hi>London;</hi> why may he not as well be abſent the whole year? if he may dwell Ten Yards out of his Pariſh, why not as many, or three times as many Miles? So that the Conventicle-Preacher when he would have proved Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63050:28"/>
to be <hi>Jure Divino</hi> from thoſe words, <hi>Abraham begat Iſaac,</hi> Mat. 1.2. might not argue ſo much at random, as you your ſelf do.</p>
            <p>And pray obſerve that you have proved more than (I hope) you deſigned, if you have proved any thing at all. For if neither Biſhops nor Incumbent Presbyters be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be reſident in their Charges any part of the year, pray who ſhall look after them? what ſtipen diary Curates? Why the Scriptures make no more mention of them, than of <hi>Parochial Conſtables,</hi> as you your ſelf ſpeak. And therefore, according to your way of talk, there is no Proviſion made by the Law of God for the Cure of Souls. You ought by all means to have ſhewed who they are who are <hi>Jure Divino</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to take care of the People, before you had diſmiſs'd the Biſhops Incumbent Presbyters from that Service.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:63050:29"/>But that which you chiefly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour at, and in proof of which half your Book was written, is to ſhew that ſerving Cures by a Proxy, and leaving all (but the Tithes) to the Curate, is not contrary to the firſt deſign of Parochial Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And, in order to this, you preſent us with a long Hiſtory of the firſt Inſtitution of Parochial Churches, which is the beſt part of your Book, and therefore leaſt to your purpoſe. And to what end you tell us this Tale of about 100 pages long I can't Divine. For I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that one ſingle Conſequence can be drawn from this relation of yours which favours your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of unlimited Plurality, and Total Non-reſidence. You wiſely excuſe your ſelf <hi>pag.</hi> 115. <hi>from framing the particular deductions, leſt you ſhould ſeem to queſtion, or injure the Judgment of your Reader.</hi> A man would rather think that you put this task upon your Reader, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was too hard for your ſelf. The chief Heads I ſhall mention,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:63050:29"/>
and ſhew how they make for you. <hi>pag.</hi> 58. You tell us <hi>'twas long e'er Pariſh-Churches were inſtituted, longer before they were endowed.</hi> What, would you infer from hence, that when they were inſtituted, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed, the particular perſons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd, and collated to them, were not obliged to ſerve, and officiate in them? Nothing elſe will ſerve your turn, and yet no ſuch conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion can be drawn from theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. What tho the office of a Parochial Prieſt be new? yet an Office it is, and muſt faithfully be diſcharged, or elſe thoſe that have it conferred on them, render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obnoxious both to the Laws of God and Man, eſpecially if any ſupervening obligations of vows, and promiſes require it of us. Any alteration in the Circumſtances of affairs, any new Commands of Superiors (if they be not unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) may lay new tyes upon our Conſciences.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:63050:30"/>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>You tell us, that <hi>all Oblations made at theſe Churches were at firſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Biſhop, who generally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided them into four parts, took one for his own maintenance, aſſigned an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to the Clergy, a third to repair the Edifices, and a fourth to the Poor.</hi> Now if you could prove that the Biſhop having all at his diſpoſal, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him a dividend who did not Preach or labour, this would be for your purpoſe; or if you had ſhewed that tho a Prieſt neglected the Buſineſs, or People to whom he was ſent, and never came near the Church to which he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, had yet his ſhare in the Dividend, this would look your way. I am perſwaded 'tis as eaſie to prove the unlawfulneſs of Non-reſidence from the firſt of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> as to conclude the non-neceſſity of it from ſuch premiſſes as theſe.</p>
            <p>But further you aſſert, <hi>pag.</hi> 59. that <hi>the firſt and general deſign of endowing Parochial Churches was, that a competent number of Clergy might
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:63050:30"/>
be maintained, who under the Biſhop ſhould ſupply the whole Dioceſe:</hi> But if ſo, what need theſe endowments be fixed to theſe Parochial Churches? why were they not rather beſtowed on the Biſhop, or the Mother Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Church? The end which you pretend had been altogether as well ſerved by this means, <hi>viz.</hi> the maintaining a competent number of Clergy to ſerve the Dioceſe in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred matters. It ſounds very odly and improbably, that our Anceſtors endowed one particular Parochial Church, that ſo by this endowment, ſome Clergy-man might be enabled to ſerve in other parts of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe. Any one who had not a mind to impoſe on himſelf, or others, would rather think, that when an Eſtate was ſettled on any particular Church, the deſign of the Donor chiefly was that he who ſerved in it ſhould have the profit of it: unleſs we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine thoſe Pious Men to have had ſuch tricks in their Heads as thoſe in the beginning of our late Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, who pretending a zeal for the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:63050:31"/>
Revenues of the Church, founded Lectures in the City out of Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations purchaſed in the remoteſt parts of the Kingdom. But before I diſmiſs this point, let me obſerve to you that by your own confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Endowments of Parochial Churches were only deſigned to maintain the Clergy who were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in that Dioceſe, whereof the Church ſo endowed was a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: and therefore this (if true) would not juſtifie thoſe, who being Beneficed in one Dioceſe, beſtow their labour, or live lazily in another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond deſign,</hi> you ſay, <hi>was to provide for the Convenience of every particular Pariſh,</hi> and you might as well have call'd this the firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: <hi>this you ſay was permitted to the direction of the Biſhop to alter it at diſcretion.</hi> And you do not tell us upon what grounds you ſay this, I ſuppoſe it was only to introduce what follows, <hi>viz.</hi> pag. 61. <hi>if it be more for the good of the Dioceſe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:63050:31"/>
or Church in general, That any Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter ſhould retain Plurality of Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or be Non-reſident at one or both of them, then it's more conſonant to the firſt deſign of Endowments, That ſuch Plurality ſhould be allowed, and Non-reſidence diſpenſed with, than otherwiſe;</hi> but you ought to have proved that Biſhops pretended to any ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as that of Diſpenſations, when Pariſh-Churches were firſt endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or that the Founders did dream of a thing, which was not in uſe till long after. We have only your <hi>Ipſe dixit</hi> for this whole matter; beſide, what you writ over Night, you contradict next Morning, as you ſhall hear by and by. Farther I look upon that which you call the good of the Dioceſe, or Church in general, to be no more than the enriching and eaſing ſome few of the Clergy. 'Tis ſurely moſt for the good of the Dioceſe, and whole Church, that ſuch Clergymen as are moſt able to do good, ſhould be diſperſed amongſt the ſeveral parts, and Regions of it. And whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

was the deſign of the Clergy in receiving theſe endowments, there is no Queſtion to be made, but the Thanes or great Men who were the givers of them, (and by whoſe intentions we are to be determined in this matter) reſpected chiefly the convenience of thoſe Pariſhes, where they erected Churches. The whole Dioceſe was in ſome meaſure provided for before out of the common Stock or Treaſury: And therefore the main end that Founders could propoſe in ſetling Eſtates upon particular Pariſh-Churches, could not be any other than the conſtant Supply thereof in Divine things.</p>
            <p>And to make what I ſay more plain, you tell us that <hi>Biſhops en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed ſome parochial Churches for the convenience of their Tenants.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 90.</note> Now how can it be reconciled to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sence, <hi>viz.</hi> That Biſhops had this primary deſign in erecting, and endowing theſe Churches, not that the Pariſhes ſo endowed might
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:63050:32"/>
have a Prieſt conſtantly attending, ſo much as that the whole Dioceſe might be ſupplied with a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Number of Clergymen; when whatever he gave, according to your Notion, belonged before to the common Stock of the Dioceſe: and ſo the deſign of maintaining a competent Number of Clergy was as well ſerved before this Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as afterward.</p>
            <p>The ſum of what need be ſaid on this matter is, That whatever meaning the Biſhop and Clergy had in accepting theſe Endowments (which yet I believe were very honeſt, and far otherwiſe than you would have us think) for certain thoſe who gave them did chiefly intend the good and convenience of that Pariſh, where they ſetled a Maintenance. And all Rules of Gratitude and Piety oblige us to apply all Endowments according to the Will of the Donours. And at firſt they could not ſo much as ſuſpect, that their deſigns ſhould
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:63050:33"/>
be eluded. Foraſmuch as in that age the Notion of ſerving a Cure by Proxy was not ſtarted. And that that this was their firſt Intention, you your ſelf after having made a great ſtir, and buſtle, do at laſt humbly acknowledge; For pag. 85, 86, 87. You tell us that <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh-Prieſts and Churches were not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſettled till the Biſhops con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented that the whole Revenue of the Endowment were perpetually annexed to the Church of that Clerk who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, i. e.</hi> in plain Engliſh, till the Incumbent might have the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate belonging to the Church in which he ſerved; and not only ſo, but before theſe great Men could generally be brought to ſettle their Endowments, <hi>Pariſh-Prieſts were forbid to quit their Cures without the leave of their Dioceſan.</hi> pag. 88. Now what is the reaſon that theſe good men would not part with their worldly goods to encreaſe the common Treaſure of the Dioceſe, ſince as you tell us, <hi>pag.</hi> 59. the firſt and general deſign of theſe <hi>endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:63050:33"/>
was to maintain a competent number of Clergy to ſerve the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe?</hi> what made them ſo ſhy, and backward in their Benefactions, till they were aſſured the Incumbent ſhould have all, and that he who miniſtred ſhould have the Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp; that thoſe who were at firſt inſtituted on a Benefice ſhould not eaſily be diſmiſſed from it? Truth will out, and after all your forced ſtuffe and whipt Creame, you can't forbear to contradict your ſelf, and in effect to give up your Cauſe.</p>
            <p>Formerly, that is before the 8th Century (as you tell us) all Oblations, and Profits were at the diſpoſal of the Biſhop, ſo that no one who gave any thing to the officiating Miniſter, or endowed a Church, could be ſure that he who laboured ſhould have the Penny: and beſides, Clergy-men were light and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and often forſook their Cures, and no one would ſtay at a Church any longer than he thought fit, but
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63050:34"/>
               <hi>pag.</hi> 85. <hi>Before the year</hi> 800, <hi>theſe two reaſons, which chiefly diſcouraged the Erection and Endowment of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh-Churches were taken away.</hi> But ſuppoſe theſe well-meaning Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen had foreſeen any ſuch things, as perpetual Non-reſidence, and ſerving Cures by Subſtitutes, would not this have ſtopt their Charity? For by this means it is again brought about, That the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Endowments of any Pariſh <hi>do only increaſe the Common Treaſure of the Dioceſe,</hi> or ſome particular men ſometimes in, ſometimes out of it; and the Church is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſerved than if it had no more than a bare Competence for the Curate. Why ſhould not the old Thanes be as well ſatisfied in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Revenues of the Church at the abſolute diſpoſal of the Dioceſan, as of one, who was to do little or nothing for it, and ſeldom ſee the Pariſhioners, but when he came to poll them? So that thoſe who were the beſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63050:34"/>
to the Church, and to whoſe Piety under God the Clergy owe their preſent Subſiſtence, were in no one thing more abuſed than by the Permiſſion of enormous Pluralities, and idle Incumbents.</p>
            <p>For the time to come you had better keep your Antiquities in your Common Place-Book, than gratifie your itch in vending of them, when they ſo little ſerve your purpoſe, that they do the quite contrary. And I believe on reading over what you had writ, you were ſenſible of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeem willing to compound the matter, <hi>pag.</hi> 152, <hi>as ſuppoſing that in</hi> 1100 <hi>years time the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of things may be altered.</hi> But then what need all this Pother about the firſt Inſtitution, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment of Parochial Churches?

            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:63050:35"/>You are indeed ſo inconſiſtent and unreſolved in this whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, That 'twill be a very difficult thing to reconcile <hi>Anthony</hi> to <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Pag.</hi> 73. You tell us, <hi>in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Century, there were none but Itinerant Preachers:</hi> nay, in the 8th Century, or the year 731 <hi>there were no other but Pluraliſt Clergymen, who had not the care of any particular Pariſh; but executed their Office in this or that, or all the Churches of the Dioceſe, as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop ſhould direct them, pag.</hi> 74. and yet before you had writ three Pages more, you were quite of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mind, for you tell us that <hi>about the year</hi> 700, <hi>Oratories and Churches were erected and endowed with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Maintenance for the Incumbent, which ſhould there reſide, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the holy Function.</hi> pag. 77. And you ſay the reaſon why before the year 800, Parochial diviſions were not generally received was, <hi>becauſe Incumbents thro' levity would often
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:63050:35"/>
quit their Churches.</hi> pag. 85. So that ſometimes there were none but Itinerants, before the 8th Century; at other times you tell us there were notwithſtanding this, Incumbents too, who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to reſide: or when you have a mind to it there were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbents: but when you think it for your purpoſe, you can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently annihilate them again. Nay, do but put your two great impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Parochial Settlement together, and they will break one another in pieces. <hi>For the firſt was, that the Biſhop had the Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Oblations, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits. The ſecond was, that Presbyters would leave their Churches in hopes of getting richer.</hi> pag. 85, 87. But now if all were at the Biſhop's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, and he that officiated had not the Eſtate, wherefore ſhould he deſire a richer Church? If ſome Churches were richer to the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter than other, how was all at the Biſhop's diſpoſal? When you
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:63050:36"/>
have reconciled your ſelf to your ſelf, and let me know, where I may find you, you may hear further from me. You have here aſſerted I can't tell what, but I am ſure palpable contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>However you have ſufficiently cleared theſe two points, <hi>viz.</hi> That before Parochial Endowments were compleated, the Biſhop <hi>pag.</hi> 85, 86. <hi>condeſcended</hi> to part with his right of diſpoſing the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Revenues; becauſe otherwiſe the Laymen would not condeſcend to Endow any more Churches; and, That <hi>all Pariſh-Prieſts were forbid to quit their Cures without the leave of their Dioceſan, and it was ordered that at their Inſtitution, or before their Ordination, the Clergy ſhould promiſe to remain at that place to which they were ordained,</hi> pag. 88, 89, which is contrary enough to what you undertook to prove, <hi>That
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:63050:36"/>
Plurality</hi> (by which you mean holding any number of Benefices, tho' at never ſo great a diſtance) <hi>is not contrary to the firſt deſign of Parochial Endowments.</hi> But hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto you have only talked like a man that wanted to be drove to his Church, where he is Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent; but under the next Head you Diſcourſe after ſo lewd a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as that you deſerve to be laſht out of it, as ſhall preſently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Vicars are by their Oaths obliged to local reſidence, unleſs they be diſpenſed with. For if they be, they are obliged no more than Rectors. The Oath of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence injoined to be taken by Vicars at their Inſtitution is, <hi>You ſhall Swear to reſide on your Vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of N. unleſs you ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with to the contrary;</hi> ſo that he who is diſpenſed with, is not by virtue of this Oath tyed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:63050:37"/>
But to be ſo far reſident as effectually to anſwer all the deſign, and ends of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, is a thing in it ſelf neceſſary, whether this Oath be taken or not, and therefore can't be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed. The Law by <hi>reſidence</hi> never means any thing elſe but living in the Pariſh where you are beneficed. Now tho' this be not always abſolutely neceſſary, yet 'tis neceſſary for that perſon who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſworn thus to do, except he be diſpenſed with, is not diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed withall.</p>
            <p>And every one who knows any thing of an Oath hath therefore juſt cauſe to wonder at that bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and wicked aſſertion of yours, <hi>pag.</hi> 116, 117. viz. <hi>Vicars can't in conſcience be impleaded of Perjury againſt their Oath of Reſidence, who being Non-reſident, maintain Curates conſtantly reſiding.</hi> How! not they guilty of Perjury, who having
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:63050:37"/>
ſworn reſidence do not reſide! In God's Name, who then can be guilty of that Sin? If indeed you had ſaid that Vicars having the Biſhop's Diſpenſation are not forſworn if they are Non-reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, you had ſaid truth. But the neceſſity of a Diſpenſation you nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuppoſe nor allow of. For your reaſon is only this, <hi>ibidem. The Law is beſt interpreted by its known deſign, and that the known deſign of this Canon was that no Parochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Church ſhould be deſtitute of the preſence of a Prieſt, which muſt needs have happened, if Vicars had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be Non-reſident, becauſe they had but juſt enough to maintain themſelves: and the Canon makes no proviſion for Vicars, able to maintain a Curate; becauſe then there were none ſuch.</hi> Now in all this the neceſſity of the Biſhop's Diſpenſation is not ſo much as intimated or imply'd, which yet is the only thing that can ſave Non-reſident Vicars from down right Perjury.<note place="margin">

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:63050:38"/>
ſay to palliate it, is but meer ſtuff, and Sham.</p>
            <p>You tell us that when this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non was made, <hi>there were no Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars able to maintain Curates:</hi> but for this we have only your bare word, and many probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the contrary. 'Tis acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that in the time of <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen Langton</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> Five Marks were determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be a competent allowance for a Vicar. But many Vicarages had been erected long before this time, and thoſe who had them were <hi>ab origine</hi> obliged to Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And though there may ſome few inſtances be produced of Vicarages, which were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove this value, yet this doth by no means prove that there were none which had better mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:63050:38"/>Further, though the Law may beſt be interpreted by the known deſign of it, yet no plain, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, literal injunctions of any Law are diſannulled by pretending that from the deſign of the Law no ſuch Concluſions can be drawn. The deſign of the Law may give us light in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, which would otherwiſe be obſcure, and difficult: or may ſerve to explain the meaning of any Oath, by it ordered to be taken. But this ſure is the firſt time, that the intention of the Law was urged as a reaſon, why an Oath preſcribed by it, ſhould be of no validity. And further it is plain that the deſign of that Canon, by which it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, was not only to ſecure the conſtant preſence of a Prieſt in every Pariſh, but that the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car himſelf ſhould be conſtantly preſent. This appears from the Oath it ſelf. For all Incumbents
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:63050:39"/>
whether Rectors or Vicars, if ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, muſt maintain a Curate whether they will or no, and whether the Revenue be ſmall or great: and if this had been the only deſign, Rectors would have been injoyned to take it as well as Vicars. And yet Rectors, tho their Benefices were not above Five Marks <hi>per annum</hi> value, were never obliged to take this Oath. And I conceive the true reaſon of Vicars being ſworn to Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, was that old rule, <hi>Vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius non habet Vicarium,</hi> a Curate (for ſuch were all Vicars origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally) is not allowed to have a Curate. And though the reaſon of this Canon now ceaſes, ſince Vicars are properly Incumbents, yet the Canon it ſelf remains in force, or elſe all our Biſhops, and Vicars General are miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:63050:39"/>Some indeed are of opinion that Deſuetude, <hi>&amp; Remotio canſae</hi> when they meet together are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to abrogate any Law. But ſo long as it is daily exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, no one muſt ſay that 'tis aboliſhed, tho the occaſion of it ſeemeth to be taken away. You indeed ſeem to argue as if you thought the Canon it ſelf anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated. But no Subject of any Society muſt take the Liberty of interpreting away Laws, which he ſees his Governours daily to exerciſe, upon pretence that the reaſon of them ceaſes. That the Law was at firſt made to oblige Vicars to actual Reſidence, you your ſelf acknowledge, and the Law remaining the ſame, 'tis not in the Power of any ſingle Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman though he be a Pluraliſt, nay though he were Univerſal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent of all the Benefices in Chriſtendom, to alter the ſenſe and firſt intention of it. And reſidence by a Curate is ſuch a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:63050:40"/>
Reſidence as neither Law nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe admits of.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the Canon is in force, and therefore to be obeyed whether enforced with an Oath or not. And whether the Canon be in force or otherwiſe, yet I am ſure the Oath is with all ſuch as have taken it, and have any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience at all. A man who hath upon Oath promiſed to do any thing, is obliged without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie to perform it, whether it were a Canonical Oath, or not, unleſs the thing he promiſed were ſinful. And indeed you act, and talk, as if you thought Reſidence to be ſo.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, I have endeavoured truly to ſtate the Caſe of Plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Non-reſidence. And tho' I have not done it with ſo much Art and Cunning, as you; yet I
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:63050:40"/>
am ſatisfied that I have placed it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a better foundation, and uſed much more impartiality than you, though I have written ſome things with a juſt reſentment. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I part with you, I muſt take leave to reflect on ſome paſſages in your Book, which I have not yet touch'd upon.</p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 134. <hi>Certainly it conduceth more to the Intereſt, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and ſupport of Religion in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and the good of the whole Dioceſe in particular, that ten or more Prebendaries, Perſons of extraordinary merit, ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly attend at the Cathedral Church, ſeated in the chief City of the Dioceſe, to ſee the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God performed with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſolemnity, to inſtruct the Inhabitants of a Populous City, and to adviſe the Biſhop upon all occaſions; than that ten little Country Villages ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63050:41"/>
by the conſtant perſonal attendance of the Incumbents of their Churches.</hi> This may all be very well allowed, except the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that theſe <hi>extraordinary perſons</hi> muſt needs be Incumbents of Country Churches. For why ſhould theſe excellent men, who are capable of doing more good elſewhere encumber themſelves with Rectories, or Vicarages ſo far remote from the Cathedral, that they cannot attend them both? It is very requiſite that City-Churches ſhould be ſupplied by the moſt able, and Eminent of the Clergy: But then why do theſe great men uſually decline City Cures? For 'tis not the Dean and Chapter, but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbents of the ſeveral Pariſh-Churches, who are generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in the Cure of Souls in Cities. By ſupplying the City Churches they might indeed do great ſervice to Religion: But this is not to be effected by on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:63050:41"/>
officiating, and that rarely in the Cathedral. If you object that the Livings in leſſer Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are uſually very mean, and unworthy of ſuch deſerving men; it may be anſwered that their Prebends would make good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for that, generally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And though Country-Livings are oftentimes of greater value, yet it muſt be conſidered that when the Curate is paid, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder will very little exceed the uſual allowance of a City-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. And I do not know any one thing wherein the High-Court of Parliament could do a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Benefit to the Church, than in annexing a Church or two of the Neighbouring City to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Prebend of the Cathedral, and indiſpenſably obliging the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen who injoyed them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form perſonal Service in them. For I cannot believe that facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could lead Captive ſo great
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:63050:42"/>
numbers of men in theſe popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Cities, if ſuch deſerving men, as many Dignitaries are, did but beſtir themſelves, and do their beſt in countermining the deſigns of our adverſaries by their Zeal, and induſtry in watching over the People. And if we look into ſuch places, we ſhall find very little ſign of care and pains that hath been uſed by the Clergy in retaining or redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing men to the ſober principles of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for Diſſenters are ſcarce any where more numerous than in theſe Cities. And though I know ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other reaſons may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for it, yet I cannot help believing that one great occaſion of it is, that ſuch Pariſh-Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are not generally ſerved by the ableſt men, and oftentimes by good Choriſters rather than good Miniſters. A good Song or Antheme may render a man
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:63050:42"/>
very agreeable company, and a good neighbour; but ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons cannot uſually compoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to that ſeriouſneſs of mind, and earneſtneſs of Piety, and Study, as to make themſelves ſucceſsful in their labours in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous and cenſorious Cities. I ſhall not take further notice of thoſe particular good deſigns, which our reformers had in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing theſe Corporations: you reckon them up well enough, and I wiſh you could ſay that theſe great ends were ſerved by them at this time. And till they are, I am ſure that they had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be doing good in their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Benefices, if they have any, than ſpend their time in the Cathedral in doing nothing at all, or at moſt, in only <hi>ſeeing</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip perform'd with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Solemnity. That nothing can excuſe them from perſonal labours in their Cures, but ſome
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:63050:43"/>
invincible Neceſſity, I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhow'd, and few of them think themſelves obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in the Cathedral above two months in the year, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts. And for the remaining part of their time I do not know where they can better be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of than amongſt their Pariſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners.</p>
            <p>Another paſſage is <hi>pag.</hi> 138, 139. <hi>It is more for the Intereſt of the Church, and Religion in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that men of eminent Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould attend in the Courts of Princes,</hi> &amp;c. This may very well be allowed of; but doth it from thence follow that theſe men muſt undertake other char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges inconſiſtent with this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance? But if you hereby mean the King's Chaplains; I do not think that the time of their attendance will be any
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:63050:43"/>
great impediment to the Cure of Souls elſewhere. And if theſe <hi>eminent men</hi> vouchſafe to take on them the charge of a <hi>few Ruſticks,</hi> (as you in contempt call them who ſhould be your care, and Crown) ſurely they will not think it below them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to take care of them too. What tho' they <hi>may learn as much as they are capable of from the meaneſt Curate?</hi> Yet it may be well ſuppoſed that ſuch great and good men as you ſpeak of, may have a greater Influence over them, that what they ſay may make more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, may be received with a more attentive mind, and fall with a greater weight; and by doing more good amongſt them than a poor Curate can; they may more effectually win and reconcile them to their Duty. And they may do this, and yet not be wanting to their Prince
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:63050:44"/>
at the ſtated times and courſes of attendance. But if they affect to be at Court, when they have no buſineſs there, but their own, and when that is nothing elſe but to ſolicite for preferment, to wrig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle into the favour of great men, to injoy better company, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge their Genius more than they can amongſt their <hi>Ruſticks;</hi> it muſt be acknowledged that this will be a great hinderance to the ſerving their Cures, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their real buſineſs. And is it not pity that men ſhould not be diſpenſed with <hi>for thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting the good of the Church elſewhere?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for Noblemen's Chaplains, who being beneficed, do actually attend, the number of them is ſo ſmall, that you might have ſav'd your ſelf the trouble of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologiſing for them. If they have
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:63050:44"/>
Benefices or Cures, they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſo near their Lords Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that they may attend both together. And Noblemen gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are unwilling to take men off from the buſineſs of their Cures, and make more conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of being the occaſion of Miniſters not reſiding, than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you would have them. You give us ſome Inſtances of Great Men, and Honourable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, who retained Domeſtick Chaplains in times of old:<note place="margin">Pag. 138.</note> but you are at a loſs it ſeems in that which you ought to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>viz.</hi> That any of theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks had charges elſewhere. And till you can ſhew this, you ſay nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>You plead likewiſe for Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops and Biſhops having Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains in their Houſes, <hi>pag.</hi> 139. And ſure no good-natur'd man
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:63050:45"/>
would abate them that Privilege: But that they are ſo <hi>neceſſary to be ſubſervient to them in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church</hi> is a new Notion. I believe the Prebenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and experienced Clergymen of the Dioceſe might do the Biſhops better Service in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. You have found out an Office for them; which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, and Conſtitutions of the Church never gave them. As for the governing of the Church, 'tis to be hoped that every Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe affords men better qualified to aſſiſt the Biſhop in it than his Chaplains, who are juſt come from ruling Lads in the Univerſities, and who themſelves ſometimes are hardly of age to be Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens.</p>
            <p>But tho' Biſhops ought to be allowed Chaplains, yet it doth not neceſſarily follow that they
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:63050:45"/>
ought to continue in their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, after they are well beneficed. Prelates are generally in a Capacity to confer or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Benefices for their Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks ſo near their Houſes, that they may in ſome meaſure at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend both together. And if they cannot do this, yet they have uſually either Prebends (<hi>though the Archbiſhop have but three,</hi> pag. 18. as you ſeem with ſome concern to obſerve) or <hi>ſine</hi> Cures to gratifie their Chaplains with, which, one would think, might ſuffice, till they could with convenience diſmiſs them. A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle care and reſolution might ſoon take off this objection.</p>
            <p>Now I ſuppoſe by this time you have put me down, if you know my Name, for one of the Traditors. And I thank you for providing me ſuch excellent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:63050:46"/>
For it ſeems Archbiſhop <hi>Williams</hi> was one of them, <hi>pag.</hi> 12. and the preſent Biſhop, of <hi>Salisbury</hi> is in your account a notorious one, nay, and the Archbiſhop himſelf muſt come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the number for Licenſing his Book,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> Bp. of <hi>S</hi>'s. <hi>Paſtoral Care</hi> pag. 250.</note> and encouraging the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to write it. But let me tell you, Sir, that I neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand your manners, nor wit, in fixing ſuch an odious Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter upon ſo deſervedly great men: Nor can I ſee how the compellation fits them. For, I never heard that they, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other of the Clergy, whom you are ſo ſevere upon, ever reſigned their Bibles, or renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their Religion, as the Traditors of old did: Nay, they have given greater demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of their Courage, and Zeal in maintaining them, than ever can be expected from you: So that I cannot make Sence of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:63050:46"/>
the expreſſion, unleſs you take it for granted that the permiſſion of Pluralities, and Non-reſidence, be as neceſſary to Religion, as the old and New Teſtament. You ſay, <hi>they betray the Outguards of Religion:</hi> I know not what you mean by the Outguards: But I am ſure enormous Plurality, and neglect of Cures cannot juſtly be ſo called. This is rather the Breach at which Seducers enter in. For if the moſt Eminent of the Clergy would once in earneſt ſet about their proper buſineſs, I ſhould not doubt, but that Schiſm and Confuſion would gradually leſſen, and perhaps at laſt alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether diſappear.</p>
            <p>Your charity runs high, when you ſay, <hi>you will not lay the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Infidelity upon all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipluraliſts,</hi> pag. 12. <hi>becauſe ſome,</hi> you hope, <hi>acted upon a miſtaken zeal,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:63050:47"/>
and falſe prejudices:</hi> But it ſhould ſeem as for the reſt you cannot abate them an Inch of this Charge. So that all are Infidels with you, who do not believe the Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Convenience of Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and Non-reſidence, unleſs invincible ignorance excuſe them. Now this is an Article which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not yet got into her Creed, but proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly they will put it into the next Edition, eſpecially ſince you have ſilenced the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Biſhops, who were the main oppoſers of it.</p>
            <p>The bitterneſs of your ſtile, and your unchriſtian way of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting would provoke a man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort the accuſation, and throw back the ill language upon your ſelf, and your Brethren: But in meer pity to you I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, as knowing that Grand
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:63050:47"/>
and Non-reſident Pluraliſts are the moſt unfit men in the World to undergo ſuch ſevere Penances as were of old inflicted on the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itors.</p>
